# login_or_achievements_widget
This custom widget displays a login window or list of user achievements for BadgeOS. It should be compatible with any version of BadgeOS installed on top of WordPress and its PHP/HTML/JavaScript/MySQL stack.

The idea behind creating this widget was to save space in the widget sidebar and avoid unnecessary clutter. The default BadgeOS achievements widget displays a message stating "you must be logged in to view achievements." Despite being a custom widget, it maintains the same functionality as the default achievements widget.
